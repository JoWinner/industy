To complete the setup:

Add your Google Maps API key
Create custom marker icons:
origin-marker.png
destination-marker.png
ship-marker.png


Removed the dependency on external marker images by using built-in Google Maps symbols
Added proper environment variable support for the Google Maps API key
Improved the map markers with custom styling
Added smooth animations for marker interactions
To complete the setup:

Replace your_google_maps_api_key_here in .env.local with your actual Google Maps API key
The map will now show:
Origin point (green circle)
Destination point (dark green circle)
Current location (green arrow)
Route line (green path)
Interactive markers with info windows
The tracking page now provides a more professional and reliable map visualization of shipment routes. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the styling or functionality?
